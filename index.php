		  <h2>About Me</h2>
		  <p>			
          My name is Jody Moore.  I currently live in Ft. Smith Arkansas.  In the past three years I've discovered my interest in programming. <br>I have just completed a programming certificate from Harvard Extension School and have recently received my Amazon<br> Web Services Solutions Architect-Associate Certification.  This course will help improve my PHP, Laravel, and CSS skills.<br>I look forward to working on an E-commerce style site.
